    <h1>My Favorite Books</h1>

    <h2>Fiction</h2>
    <p class="para1">One of my all-time favorite novels is <i>To Kill a Mockingbird</i> by Harper Lee. This classic
        explores themes of racial injustice and the loss of innocence in a small Southern town. The character of Atticus
        Finch, with his unwavering moral compass, has always been an inspiration to me. The book's <b>powerful
            narrative</b> and Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has
        been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and
        scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into
        electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of
        Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passage.</p>

    <h2>Non-Fiction</h2>
    <p class="para2">In the realm of non-fiction, I'm particularly fond of <i>Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind</i>
        by Yuval Noah Harari. This book offers a <b>fascinating overview</b> Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the
        printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
        when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not
        only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was
        popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages.</p>

    <h3>Recent Read</h3>
    <p class="para3">Recently, I finished reading <i>The Midnight Library</i> by Dalai Lama. Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy
        text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever
        since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It
        has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially
        unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages
