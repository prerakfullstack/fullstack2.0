    <!--Paragraph-->
    <p>
      Historically, a civilization has often been understood as a larger and
      "more advanced" culture, in implied contrast to smaller, supposedly less
      advanced cultures.[8][9][10][11] In this broad sense, a civilization
      contrasts with non-centralized tribal societies, including the cultures of
      nomadic pastoralists, Neolithic societies, or hunter-gatherers; however,
      sometimes it also contrasts with the cultures found within civilizations
      themselves. Civilizations are organized densely-populated settlements
      divided into hierarchical social classes with a ruling elite and
      subordinate urban and rural populations, which engage in intensive
      agriculture, mining, small-scale manufacture and trade. Civilization
      concentrates power, extending human control over the rest of nature,
      including over other human beings.
