Explanation:

HTML Structure: The webpage consists of a header, main, and footer section. The header contains a logo and navigation links, while the main section has three columns representing tabs.

Flexbox for Layout:

The header uses Flexbox to align the logo and navigation links horizontally.
The main section uses Flexbox with flex-wrap: wrap to manage the columns.

Responsive Design:

Desktop (â‰¥ 1024px): All three columns display in a single row.
Tablet (768px - 1023px): The columns stack into two columns with the third column below.
Mobile (< 768px): All columns stack vertically as a single column.
