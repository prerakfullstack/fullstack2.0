Explanation of the Code:

Internal CSS:

Defined within the <style> tag in the <head> section.
Styles for the body, <h1>, and <p> tags are included.

External CSS:

Linked to an external stylesheet (styles.css).
This file contains additional styles specifically for paragraphs.

Inline Styles:

Applied directly to the second <p> element using the style attribute, which sets the text color to blue and increases the font size.
