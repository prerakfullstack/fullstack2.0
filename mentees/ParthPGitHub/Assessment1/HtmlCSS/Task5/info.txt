Breakdown of the Code:
Table Structure:

The table uses <thead> for the header row, <tbody> for the body of the table, and <tfoot> for the footer.
Each section contains rows (<tr>) and cells (<th> for headers and <td> for data).

Colspan and Rowspan:

In the third row of the body, Michael Johnson's age spans two columns using colspan="2", indicating that only one column is used for the student's name.
In the footer, Total Students: 4 spans all three columns with colspan="3".

CSS Styling:

border-collapse: collapse; ensures that adjacent cell borders are merged for a cleaner look.
border, padding, and text-align styles are applied to both headers (<th>) and data cells (<td>).
Different background colors are set for the header and footer to enhance visibility.
