Explanation of the Code:

Basic Structure:

The page includes a heading and a container for the video.

Responsive Iframe:

The <div class="video-container"> is styled to maintain a 16:9 aspect ratio using padding (padding-top: 56.25%).
The <iframe> is positioned absolutely within the container, filling 100% of the width and height.

Iframe Attributes:

The src attribute contains the URL of the YouTube video.
frameborder="0" removes the default border around the iframe.
allowfullscreen allows the video to be played in fullscreen mode.
