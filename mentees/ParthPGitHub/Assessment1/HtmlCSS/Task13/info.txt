Explanation

HTML Structure:

A section with the class grid-container holds six div elements, each representing a grid cell containing different content.

Grid Layout:

The .grid-container uses CSS Grid to create a layout with two columns and three rows.
The grid-template-columns property is set to repeat(2, 1fr), which creates two equal columns.
The grid-template-rows property is set to repeat(3, auto) to create three rows, adjusting their height based on content.

Styling:

Each .grid-item is styled with a light gray background, padding, and a border for visibility.

Responsive Design:

A media query changes the layout to a single column for screens smaller than 600px.
