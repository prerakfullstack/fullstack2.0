Explanation of the Example:

Overall Structure:

The webpage is wrapped in a <div> with a class of container for styling and layout.

Navigation:

A horizontal navigation menu created with an unordered list (<ul>) and styled using CSS flexbox.

Sections:

Each section (#menu, #about, #contact) contains relevant content:
Menu Section: Displays coffee items in a flex layout for a neat presentation.
About Section: Includes a brief description of the coffee shop, using an inline <span> for highlighting.
Contact Section: Lists contact details, also using <span> for emphasis.

Styling:

Block elements (<h2>, <p>, <div>) stack vertically, while inline elements (<span>) allow for specific text formatting within paragraphs.
The menu items have a light background, borders, and rounded corners for a polished look.
