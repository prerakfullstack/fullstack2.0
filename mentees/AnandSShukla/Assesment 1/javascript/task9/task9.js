// Task 9: Working with Dates
// Objective: Use JavaScriptâ€™s `Date` object to manipulate dates.
// 1. Write a function that logs the current date and time.
// 2. Write another function that calculates how many days are left until your next birthday.
(function DateManipulate() {
  const d = new Date();
  console.log("todays date is ", d.toString());
})();

function daysUntilNextBirthday(birthday) {
  const today = new Date();
  const currentYear = today.getFullYear();

  let nextBirthday = new Date(
    currentYear,
    birthday.getMonth(),

  );

  if (today > nextBirthday) {
    nextBirthday.setFullYear(currentYear + 1);
  }
  const differenceInTime = nextBirthday.getTime() - today.getTime();

  const differenceInDays = Math.ceil(differenceInTime / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24));
