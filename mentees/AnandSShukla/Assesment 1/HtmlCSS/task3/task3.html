          The database industry has undergone a number of changes in recent
          years, resulting in a greater shift toward a Database as a Service
          (DBaaS) model versus On-Premise Infrastructure. Most business apps
          rely on Databases, and Cloud-based DBaaS services provide users with a
          Flexible, Scalable, and On-demand Platform that eliminates the need to
          set up costly physical hardware. MongoDB Atlas is a fully Cloud-based
          Database Service that hosts your data on MongoDB Instances. On the
          other hand, the Node.js driver provides an interface for connecting to
          and communicating with MongoDB Instances.
