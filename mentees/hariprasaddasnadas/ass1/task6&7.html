        <h1>History of t20 cricket </h1>
        <br>
        <p> Twenty20 (T20) is a shortened format of cricket. At the professional level, it was introduced by the<b> <span style="color:red;">England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) in 2003</span></b> for the inter-county competition. In a Twenty20 game, the two teams have a single innings each, which is restricted to a maximum of twenty overs. Together with first-class and List A cricket, Twenty20 is one of the three forms of cricket recognised by the International Cricket Council (ICC) as being played at the highest level, both internationally and domestically.</p>
