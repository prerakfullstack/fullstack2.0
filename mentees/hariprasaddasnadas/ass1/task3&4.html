    <h1 >History of t20 cricket </h1>
    <div class="History">
        <p > Twenty20 (T20) is a shortened format of cricket. At the professional level, it was introduced by the<b> England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) in 2003</b> for the inter-county competition. In a Twenty20 game, the two teams have a single innings each, which is restricted to a maximum of twenty overs. Together with first-class and List A cricket, Twenty20 is one of the three forms of cricket recognised by the International Cricket Council (ICC) as being played at the highest level, both internationally and domestically.</p>

    <h2  >Origins </h2>
    <div class="Origins">
      <P>When the Benson & Hedges Cup ended in 2002, the ECB sought another one-day competition to fill with the younger generation in response to dwindling crowds and reduced sponsorship. The Board wanted to deliver fast-paced, exciting cricket accessible to fans who were put off by the longer versions of the game.Stuart Robertson, the marketing manager of the ECB, proposed a 20-over-per-innings game, invented by New Zealand cricketer Martin Crowe, to county chairmen in 2001, and they voted 11-7 in favour of adopting the new format.</P>
